    "skills": "Good day!\n\nIn addition to my professional activities, currently, I am interested in programming. It is interesting to me because any problem, even the most complex, can be solved with a standard set of characters, and it would be better if you have used less characters in code.\n\nIn ordinary life, we try to express a thought with many words, use synonyms, quotes, abstract examples, and so on. In programming, everything is exactly the opposite. It's really exciting to find solutions to problems by going over the available options in your mind, by the exercise of some ingenuity. Even minor differences in tasks lead to a different set of characters used.\n\nI now devote my free time to solving such problems: https://www.hackerrank.com/zov9262385646 .\n\nI always try to do my job as well as possible, even outside of direct employment, as can be evidenced by some results, such as, for instance: the publication of an article on the website of the RANEPA School of IT Management: http://journal.itmane.ru/node/1920, to the final work, the result of which was noted by the attestation commission.\n\nI sincerely hope that I was able to reflect my experience as accurately as possible and reveal my personal qualities. And it would be a pleasure for me to provide additional information if you need it.\n\nBest regards,\nOlga Zaykovskaya ",
